### Electron Desktop App

Use the bundled Electron shell when you need an offline-friendly desktop build that remembers the ERPNext server URL.

1. **Install dependencies** (root): `yarn install`
2. **Run the desktop shell**: `yarn electron:dev`
3. **Build installers**: `yarn electron:build`

Notes:

- The app prompts for the server URL on first launch (the `/app/posapp` path is added automatically) and saves it locally so you do not need to re-enter it.
- If connectivity drops, an offline screen appears with options to retry or change the saved server.
- Windows (`.exe`) builds require Wine/Mono when running `electron-builder` on Linux. By default, `yarn electron:build` targets the current platform and writes artifacts into `dist-electron/`.
